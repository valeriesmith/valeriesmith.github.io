        <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p><span class="inline_title">My Reflection:</span>I really enjoyed learning about responsive web design, although I feel as though I have only scratched the surface.  I would love to get better at it.  I'm still not sure that I am using CSS media queries properly or that I understand the best practices of setting up the CSS.</p>

        <p>This was a pairing challenge.  We initially misunderstood the directions. I didn't understand that we were supposed to create a page that toggled in and out of two states, meaning that the nav bar would move when the browser window was shrunk to a certain width, and so forth. Instead, we implemented the changes in the main part of the CSS.  We also got stuck on how to use CSS media queries, even after googling together.  We ended up not finishing the challenge, but then working independently later in the day before getting back together on chat in the evening.  My pair was lovely to work with and I felt like we were really collaborating during the initial hangout, so that was good.</p>

        <p>Some notes on pairing: I've identified this as an area where I need improvement.  I need to get better at working through ideas WITH my pair, and fighting the urge to just table issues to go back to them later on my own.  I need to work on not being afraid to show that I don't know things, and have more confidence in the things I do know. My tendency is to go back and revisit the work on my own, because I feel like this is the best way I learn.  I plan on doing some research on pair programming in the coming weeks, and maybe also practicing thinking through things out loud when I am working by myself.</p>

        <p>I didn't discover the emulator in dev tools until after we had finished. I had a lot of trouble setting it up but once I did, I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
