    <td> <h2>Why I'm at DBC</h2>
       <p>I'm currently attending Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. Before making the leap into web development, I worked as a production manager and lead in the apparel and luxury consumer goods industries, and before that, I was an interaction designer - all wireframes all the time.</p>
       <p>In October of 2013, I attended a <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/" target="_blank">Railsbridge</a> workshop and really enjoyed it. I first heard of Dev Bootcamp on that day, but I didn't think that it was something I would ever be qualified to do. I decided to spend some time teaching myself Ruby to see how I liked coding. After about six months of working through Zed Shaw's  <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> and going to Ruby meetups, I applied and was accepted to DBC.</p>

      <p>My immediate goal after DBC is to find work at an entry level dev, and keep learning as much as I can.  In the long term, I'd like to work on developing applications to help seniors stay connected with their communities.</p>


      <h2>A few more or less interesting things about me personally:</h2>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
      <li>I studied pattern making at the <a href="http://www.ecole-couture-parisienne.com/" target="_blank">&Eacute;cole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne</a> in Paris and at <a href="http://www.apparel-arts.com/" target="_blank">Apparel Arts</a> in SF  but have never gotten serious about it professionally. I love the process draping and drafting to come up with working patterns, but don't love the fashion business.</li><p></p>
      <p></p>
      <li>I live in Oakland, California with my husband and Mr. B, a small but vocal dog.</li>
