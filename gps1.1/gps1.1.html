      <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Pair programming is the practice of collaborating on programming tasks / projects between 2 developers.<br>
        Collaborating in this way has been proven to be very effective both to accelerate the task / project and the learning process of the developers.<br>
        The following are the main types of pair programming:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Driver / Navigator</li>
        <li>Ping Pong</li>
        <li>Novice / Expert</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>
        It is very important and has grown in popularity among many companies. As written above it's amazing'
      </p>

      <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
      <p>
        Driver is driving and Navigator is navigating!
      </p>
      <h2>Valerie's Reflection</h2>
      <p>This was actually my second time pairing, but my first time pairing with a guide.  Overall, it was enjoyable and I learned a lot.  I find pairing challenging because I am not used to thinking out loud. This is something I need to work on, maybe by practicing thinking through the challenges out loud when I'm by myself to get more used to it. </p>

       <p>Because I had less experience with HTML and CSS, it seemed like the driver/navigator model broke down a bit, and by the end, I was being coached by Stefano.  For me, this was great. I learned a lot, and he was encouraging me to think rather than dictating the answers. However, I'm worried that it was frustrating for him, and I also feel as though I didn't contribute equally to the session.</p>

        <p>We did run into a few technical glitches with Google Hangout.  When all three of us were on video and unmuted microphones, there was a lot of choppiness and feedback. We resolved this issue by turning off the video after the check-in (we turned it back on at the end to say goodbye), and our guide turned off his microphone unless he wanted to speak.  That worked out well.</p>

        <h2>Stefano's Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I am so very happy that we went through this pairing session. Pairing is always a great opportunity to learn both at a technical level and at a human level, both of which are very crucial aspects of a developer's success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically it was good to be reminded to stay focused and learn how to catch the tiniest details (another very important skill for a developer). <br>
        At a human level this was a very enriching experience in terms of learning how to be of best support and realize once again that productivity is not goal. It is how we grow together as a team, how we build together that matters most, and from experience I can say that once we know that this is the focus, productivity will naturally be great.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am grateful to have more and more opportunities to grow and learn from others.
