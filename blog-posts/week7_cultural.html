      <h2>Personal Values and Stereotype Threat</h2><br>

      <span class="post-date">October 8, 2014</span>

<h3>Values</h3>

<p>It's hard to select just one or two values from the list we were given.  I consider will-power an important value, especially right now as I prepare to start the on-site part of DBC. Will-power is the means by which I force myself to do things that are unappealing in the moment but that are ultimately beneficial to me or to the people I care about. </p>

<p>Kindness is the second value that I chose, even though it's not on the list. This is a value that I have acquired over time, by witnessing the kind and unkind behavior around me.  As we've discussed when talking about feedback, kind and nice are not the same thing.  To me, kindness means being able to treat others with genuine respect and not be driven by the needs of my own ego.</p>

<p>I am not always successful in living up to either of these values.  On a scale of three to 5, I think I'm about a 3 for will-power right now.  I find that I don't seem to be able to maintain will-power across all areas of my life at once.  Right now, I'm doing well at getting up early,  getting my DBC phase 0 work done, and exercising.  Every Sunday,I make a work and exercise roadmap for the coming week so that my tasks are broken down into chunks.  This habit supports my will-power.  However, I am not doing well right now with eating healthy food at appropriate times of the day, even though I consider doing so important for my health. I haven't taken the time to develop habits and routines to support this goal when I'm busy and stressed-out.  If I put a bowl of carrots and other veggies out every morning, I will eat them throughout the day, and if I take a break to eat dinner around 6pm, I won't be starved and order takeout at 9pm.</p>
   
<p>As far as kindness is concerned,  I also consider myself a three - in the middle of the scale.  I'm not a villain, but my thoughts and actions are not always in line with this value.  I have worked hard at training myself to practice empathy towards the people I encounter every day, but there are definitely situations in my close relationships that provoke knee-jerk reactions.  I find it really hard sometimes to take a step back and ask myself if it's productive to get upset over things that are not important or that I can't change.  It's also hard for me to feel kindness towards people who do things that I find morally reprehensible (mean to animals, lack of civic-mindedness, etc.)  I'm just not there yet and I don't know if I ever will be.</p>


<h3>Advice</h3>

<p>The last time I was asked for advice was by a friend. She wanted my advice about what shoes to buy to go with a skirt for a formal event.  I can't say that this relates to my values. I do like shoes but I'm also a lot less interested in clothing and fashion trends than I used to be.  My priorities around how I want to spend my mental energy and money have changed.  I went through a very difficult period financially and emotionally a few years ago,  and it completely changed the way I feel about the acquisition of material goods. At the same time this was going on, I read <a href="http://www.overdressedthebook.com/">Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion</a>, which is a book by Elizabeth Cline about how <em>fast fashion</em> companies like H&amp;M and Forever 21 have changed the fashion industry and our habits as consumers. I was already on the fence, but reading this book really helped bring about a change in how I view the consumption of clothing and consumer goods. That being said, I still like a good pair of shoes and my wallet is not safe at <a href="http://www.britexfabrics.com">Britex Fabrics</a>.</p>  

<h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>

<p>I think of my values as a work in progress.  I will probably always need to work to align my daily thoughts and actions with my values.   I think that recognizing stereotype threat is the first step towards mediating it.  Equally important but harder is having a plan to combat negative feelings as they arise.  Hardest is figuring out how to deal with being stereotyped by others.  I find that physical exercise such as walking or working out at the gym is beneficial when I'm feeling down, so I definitely plan to use that as time permits.  When I feel bad, I also find it's helpful to try to focus on some concrete, manageable problem or task instead of beating myself up. </p>
