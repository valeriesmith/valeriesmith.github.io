    <tr><td class="post_content"></td><td class="post_content">
<p>One of the biggest problems facing the technology industry today is the lack of skilled workers.  At the same time, a large segment of the workforce is still unemployed or underemployed due to obsolete skill sets.</p>

<p>Even with programs like Dev Bootcamp, it still seems to me that re-training to become a developer is still out of reach for most of the population, especially people over a certain age threshold.  I started studying Ruby almost a year ago, and now am enrolled at DBC.  It was a lot of work, and I'm proud of myself for having gotten this far, but I realize that there are many external factors that made it possible.  It's a huge luxury, in terms of time and money (of course, the two are related.) I can't imagine doing this under different personal circumstances</p>

<p>Obviously, the best way to prepare for the future of the technology workforce is to teach it beginning in elementary school.  This is already happening.  Coding-based vocational training for high school students is another way to start building the workforce.  Being trained to get a job as a developer right out of high school is not a bad alternative for those who don't wish to or don't have the means to pursue a traditional university education.  With the cost of post-secondary education rising disproportionately quickly, vocational training during high school would certainly be appealing to many young adults.</p>

<p>Older people are a huge untapped potential workforce.  There is no reason that a retired person could not be retrained as a developer, especially once we start talking about fixed mindset vs growth mindset.  There's no cut off point at which our brains stop working, under normal circumstances.  However, there are huge obstacles for an older person seeking re-employment in the tech industry, particularly in a  startup environment.  These are mostly related to age bias and perceived culture fit.</p>

<p>To summarize, I think that I've sketched out some ideas to address the tech worker shortage, but these are big picture ideas, and the devil is in the details. I am sure I will be thinking about these issues a lot over the coming months.</p>
