 <p>I have been using this site every day for several months, because I'm sick of my music collection on iTunes, and to expose myself to different types of music. I splurged and got the subscription service, which is worth it to me since I have it on constantly. The focal point of the site is the area where the track information is displayed. The name of the track and the album art take up most of the real estate in the center of the page, which I would expect since I go there to listen to tracks.  Visually, I'd describe the site as minimalist, utilitarian, modular, neutral, and boxy. It isn't badly designed but it's very simple and focused; there isn't a lot of extraneous content visible at the top level.</p>
 <p>
The site solves the problem of providing a visual representation of a radio.   Of course, it's more customizable than a traditional radio (not sure about satellite radio, I've never used it.)  The content consists a Now Playing area that shows the current track as well as the tracks that were just played, along with information about the artist..  Simple controls allow the user to rate, pause, and skip tracks, as well as control the volume.  On the left is a list of the stations I've created, with the option to add a new station or fine tune my current stations.  I'd describe the content as entertaining, useful, streamlined, customizable, and lightweight.  These descriptors align with the visual design of the site.</p>
<p>
Since the homepage is uncluttered, and contains relatively few elements, it's easy to select a station and start playing it.  The button for creating a new station is at the top left of the site, which doesn't make sense to me. I would have put it on the left nav bar at the bottom of the list of existing stations, to group all of the station related information and tasks together.  The site is designed so that the Now Playing button is always accessible, so it's easy to get back to the main page. The company related links are grouped together in the footer, which is what I would expect. It's easy to browse through the site content since it is all accessible from the home page, or one level down.</p>
<p>I never spend a lot of time at once on Pandora, I usually just visit it to change the station, or to add variety to a particular station if I have thought of a particular artist or track I'd like to hear.  If I spent a lot of time on the site, I'd probably feel guilty about wasting time when I should be working.  The site sells tracks through iTunes or Amazon. I haven't purchased any, for no good reason other than that I'm satisfied with the variety on Pandora.</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a></p>
<p>I like Pinterest, since it allows me to collect images that I find useful or inspirational.  I draft patterns and sew clothes in my spare time (so basically never), and I use Pinterest to catalogue my ideas, and see what other people are doing.  The content is different every time I go to the home page,  so my eye is drawn to whatever image I find most striking at that moment, or whatever image annoys me the most.   The images on the home page take up most of the real estate on the site and are the most important part of the site.   Visually, I would describe Pinterest as busy, stimulating, organized, strongly graphical, and monochromatic.
</p>
<p>This website allows users to collect and share visual content.  The content is entirely user-generated, and consists of images, descriptive text, and information about the person who pinned the image.  I would describe the content of the site as aspirational, entertaining, beautiful, materialistic, and annoying (sometimes.)  To some extent, the words I used to describe the content map to its visual appearance, neither is static, so I have different impressions of the site each time I visit.
</p>
<p>I don't find it easy to find particular things on this site. If there is an image I want to go back to, I usually re-pin it to one of my own boards. I would like to be able to default to seeing only my own boards, or the boards of people I follow when I go to the home page. I also don't like all of the random content that shows up on the home page.  I also hate that there is no link to see the people I am following on the home page.  I have to click on my Profile link first. Pinterest seems hell-bent on making me look at content that I did not choose.  As far as browsing through the content that appears on the homepage, it's easy to look through.
</p>
<p>After I have been on Pinterest for a while, I feel over stimulated and usually irritated because I've wasted time looking for specific things that I can't find.  However, I still like it because I think it's a good way to gather images and be inspired.  I treat Pinterest in the same way that I would a fashion magazine.  I don't think that Pinterest sells anything directly.</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com" target="_blank">SFGate.com</a></p>
<p>I am not sure I would say it's my favorite site in terms of design, but I visit it every day for local news.  It's useful.  The first thing that draws my eye on the site is the top three lead stories, which take up the area below the navigation bar.  Interestingly, these don't seem to be the most important stores on the site in comparison to all of the other headlines.  So, I'd say that the lead story module is not the most important area of the site.
</p>
<p>Visually, I would describe the website as cluttered, text-heavy, dense, dated, and disorganized.  This is an online news source, and provides local and national news and other content to its users.  The site is divided into sections that mimic the sections of a print newspaper.  I would describe the content as informative, entertaining, advertising-heavy, dynamic, and local.  The variety of content on the site is echoed in the visual design, which is cluttered.
</p>
<p>I use this website to check local news, look at the photo gallery for the day if I feel like it, and sometimes read the restaurant reviews.  It's pretty easy to so these three things.  The local news is above the fold, photo gallery is always in the same place in the middle, and the link to the food section is at in the navigation bar at the top of the page.  From a sub page, it's easy to go back to the homepage, or another section of the site by using the top navigation.  Browsing could be easier, mainly because the news is broken down into buckets and crowded on the page. I think that a more linear format within each section would be easier to read. I usually get bored with the site after about ten minutes, because the content is not organized in a way that is easy to scan.
</p>
<p>The site sells subscriptions to the print version of the paper. I have not purchased it since I get my news on line.</p>
<p>Comparing these three websites is a bit difficult because they all serve different purposes. Of the three I would say that the visual and functional alignment of Pandora is the best. It does one thing, and the minimalism of the design and the placement of the elements on the page reflects that.  With Pinterest, I would say that the design of the site draws the focus to what the company wants the user to see - recommended pins from other users.  The design and content reflects this, even though it's not necessarily in line with how I want to use that site, which is to store my own content, and content from people I already know and trust.  SFGate is a news website, and its design is based on the traditional model of a newspaper with headlines and sections.  At this point, I think that people are familiar enough with reading news online that they don't need such a literal representation.  We understand that it is a digital version of a physical artifact. Pandora is the same, but it doesn't literally look like a representation of a radio.</p>
