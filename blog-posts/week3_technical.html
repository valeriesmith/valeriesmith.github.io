    <p>Javascript's popularity stems from the fact that is able to be interpreted by most browsers without any action on the part of the user.  From the perspective of a web developer, JavaScript is lightweight and easy to use.  The code can be written in any text editor, and it is immediately ready to be tested and deployed without having to be compiled.</p>
<h3>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h3>
<p>Javascript is easy to learn, especially for people who have experience with other object oriented programming languages.  The structure, syntax, and names of things in JavaScript will be familiar to a Ruby programmer, for instance.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, JavaScript is embedded in most browsers.  It will automatically work without requiring the user to download a plug-in.  The exception to this is if a user has specifically disabled Javascript in the browser.</p>

<p>Javascript allows for client-side interactivity.  What this means is that the page can change in response to user input, such as moving something around on the web page or clicking a button, without the page having to talk to the server and reload its contents.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of development, there are a lot of resources available to extend JavaScript's functionality and to make it fast and easy to build useful web sites.</p>

<h3>What are its limitations?</h3>

<p>Used by itself, JavaScript only works on the front end.  This means that a page written in JavaScript can't take a user's information, and store it on a server.  In order for server side interaction to happen, we have to use additional technology such as Ajax or Node.js.</p>

<p>For security reasons, JavaScript cannot change anything outside of the web page on which it exists.  If this were possible, JavaScript could be programmed to look at other web pages and possibly make changes that could harm the user's system.  Javascript CAN write to cookies, which are small files that are associated with a particular website.</p>

<p>If JavaScript is disabled on a particular browser, the page won't work.  There is no way for the developer to control this.</p>

<p>Like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is not interpreted identically across all browsers.  This means that developers have to test their scripts extensively and make allowances for how they work in all different browsers.  Alternatively, developers can decide to make the scripts work only in the most popular browsers.</p>
