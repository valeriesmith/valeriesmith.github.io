      <h2>Pairing and Feedback at DBC</h2><br>

      <span class="post-date">September 28, 2014</span>
      <h3>Pairing</h3>

<p>At the beginning of DBC, the combination of my lack of confidence in my technical ability and my feeling of social awkwardness made me dread pairing.  Over the past five weeks, it has mostly become a good experience.   I don't know if I will ever totally be in my comfort zone while pairing, especially remotely.  However, it has gotten a lot easier with practice.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with pairing is that I tend to zone out or panic when I'm faced with something I don't understand and have had to work hard to get out of that mindset.  All of a sudden, I am transported right back to eight grade math class, but I can't get a hall pass to escape to the bathroom.  Being open with my pair about the way I'm feeling when that happens has helped a bit.  I don't always feel comfortable saying that I am stuck, especially if I think that the problem is simple and I <em>should</em> be able to understand it easily.</p>

<h3>What is Effective Feedback?</h3>

<p>One of the first things we learned at DBC is how to give feedback.  In the past, I've found that people tend to be either overly critical or overly positive when giving feedback.  Thinking about whether a piece of feedback is specific, actionable, and kind has proven to be helpful in both  giving and receiving feedback.</p>

<p>Giving <em>specific</em> feedback means providing  context and detail to the recipient. For example,  if I paired with someone and had trouble hearing the person because of background noise on his or her end, I wouldn't want to simply say that I couldn't understand the conversation. Instead, I would specify that the dog barking or the background noise in the cafe made it difficult to hear. </p>

<p><em>Actionable</em> and specific feedback are related.  The more specific the feedback, the more likely it is to be actionable.  In the example above,  by identifying the source of the problem,  I give the recipient the opportunity to take action and change the situation.  There isn't much point in giving feedback about something that can't be changed or that is beyond the receiver's control.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that <em>kind</em> and  <i>nice</i> are not equivalent.  When I think of nice, I think of the stereotypical way of insulting someone by saying something catty or mean followed by a <em>blessherheart.</em>  Couching negative feedback in this way is not necessarily helpful, and it's condescending because I'm assuming that the recipient can't accept constructive feedback unless it's sugar-coated.  It lessens the value of the positive things that I do say, since the receiver might think that I'm only saying something good in order to be able to say something bad. To me, providing kind feedback means being respectful of the other person's feelings, recognizing when something is beyond the person's control, and imagining how I myself would feel if I received the same feedback.</p>

<h3>My own Experience with Feedback at DBC</h3>

<p>Overall, the feedback I've received from my fellow students and from the guides at DBC has been incredibly helpful. I wouldn't say that it makes me feel vulnerable. On the contrary,  it has helped me to realize that people are not judging me as harshly as I judge myself even though I do have some issues to work on.  There is definitely a common thread in a lot of the feedback I've received. I need to work on feeling confident, and in being more vocal when working through problems. The specific feedback I've received about these issues has helped me create a roadmap for improvement.  Also,  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my fellow students think I am friendly and pleasant, since I have never thought of myself that way.</p>
