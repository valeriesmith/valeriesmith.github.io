<p>This week we're being asked to write an overview of the differences between SQL and noSQL databases, as well as to examine the advantages and disadvantages of each model.</p>

<h3>Schema</h3>

<p>The biggest difference between these two types of databases is the way that data is stored.  SQL databases are highly structured.  Information is stored in tables whose structure is described by schemas. All the columns in a given table are bound together and is considered an entity.  Information is referenced between tables by creating keys that entities can share, and by using <strong>JOIN</strong> statements to select and display certain parts of each entity. Data in SQL databases are <em>constrained</em> by the structure of their tables. This structure makes the database more stable, but its downside is that it can be difficult to add to or change the structure of entities in the database.</p>

<p>NoSQL databases are model-less.  They do not use schemas to form entities.  Data is stored and accessed in key-value pairs, as documents, or in columns where all of the values of a given column are stored together, separated by a delimiter.  Because of this flexibility, it's easier to create entities in NoSQL databases.  They are generally considered more flexible and more easily extensible than SQL databases for this reason. However, they are not considered as powerful or robust as SQL databases.</p>

<h3>Queries</h3>

<p>All SQL databases use the SQL language, so queries are standardized. SQL is widely supported and it's relatively easy to find information about how to write queries. SQL is a highly structured language that allows for complex data queries. However, because of the complexity of the relationships between different tables, data can be difficult to access and queries hard to write and understand.  NoSQL databases have no standardized way to perform queries.  Because the data structures in noSQL databases are flatter, searches can be completed quickly, and the user never has to worry about joining tables together.  The tradeoff between the two is flexibility, speed, and ease of access for complexity and depth.</p>

<h3>Scalability and Hardware Requirements</h3>

<p>SQL databases are not horizontally scalable, which means that as they grow larger, they cannot easily be split up across multiple servers. Additional capability is usually added by adding more memory or space to an existing server.  NoSQL databases are easily distributed across servers, making them more easily and inexpensively scalable.</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<p>SQL Databases: <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a></p>

<p>noSQL Databases: <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">Mongodb</a> and <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a></p>
