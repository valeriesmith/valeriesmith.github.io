<p>In this week's post, I'll address the art of asking technical questions. The first step in finding the answer to a question is figuring out if you even have to ask the question at all.  Has it already been answered?  Use Google to look for reference material, blog posts, or forum posts that might address your question.   If you're getting an error message, Google the error message itself.</p>

<p>In situations where the problem has many layers, break it down into parts, like you would do with a coding challenge.   I recently had an issue where I found that I could not longer install gems on my system.  Every time I tried, I would get a screenful of errors. It was completely daunting and the only way I could even begin to unravel them was to look at the errors line by line and then Google them.</p>

<p>Once you've determined that you have to ask the question, there are several ways to ensure that you get the best answer possible:</p>

<ol>

<li>Make sure you're asking your question of the right person and in the right place.  Follow the rules and etiquette of the forum you're posting to.</li>
<br>
<li>Explain what steps you have already taken to solve your problem.  It's a good idea to include information about what error messages you are getting, to show what your code looks like, and to include information about your system and the software you're using.  The key is to provide some context for your question.  It can be helpful to think of the information that you would need from someone asking you a question.</li>
<br>
<li>At the same time, your question needs to be concise and easy to read.  At the risk of pointing out the obvious, be sure to check your spelling and grammar.  Pay attention to formatting and don't make people wade through a wall of text to get to the meat of the question.  Title and tag your question appropriately.</li>
<br>
<li>When your question is answered, don't get emotional or defensive when people ask for more detail or offer constructive feedback.  Be sure to thank the person who answered your question and comment on how you implemented the solution so that other people can learn from how you did it. Remember that the person  who answered your question has taken time out of his or her day to help you.</li>

</ol>

<p>Finally, contribute!   It's the right thing to do, and people are more likely to help you if you are an active contributor who helps others in turn.  Answering questions yourself will make you a better question asker. </p>
