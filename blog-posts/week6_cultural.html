<p>This week, we're being asked to write about stereotype threat.  My first reaction when I started researching this topic was that it was going to be really hard to time box the assignment to an hour, and my second reaction was that it would be really difficult to write about it at all.</p>

<p>First, let me define stereotype threat as I understand it.  This term was coined by Claude M. Steele, a social psychologist  and academic.  In the simplest terms, stereotype threat is the negative effect on performance -  typically academic, professional, or athletic - caused by the fear that a person is being judged based on stereotypes about his or her identity.  Steele observed the lower performance of women and African-Americans on tests where the purpose of the tests was defined in a way that played into fears about being stereotyped.  For example, if the women were told before taking the test that its purpose was to measure cognitive differences between men and women, they would not perform as well as if they had been given a reason relating to the ability differences between the genders.</p>

<p>I came away from learning about stereotype threat with more questions than answers. I started thinking about how my problems are really very minor compared to those of others. I don't ever feel as though I am in danger.  I do know that a lot of women would not agree with me on this but that is my own personal take given my experiences and my admittedly sheltered environment.  What I mean is, I'm not worried about physically harmed because of my identity. That doesn't mean that I haven't felt the effects of stereotyping, but once you get past the really big things, are some types of stereotyping worse than others?  By big things I mean threats to basic well-being and the denial of things like education, work, and healthcare based on identity. Who decides? Does it change over time?  If stereotype threat and identity are situational and if they change or disappear over time, do new threats arise as the old ones disappear because of human nature?  Are we becoming more open-minded or less, or is a cycle based on external factors such as the economy, wars, and who is in power politically?  Is it OK to stereotype the stereotypers? If so, when is it OK? </p>

<p>Yesterday, I read an article about the owner of a shooting range, who decided that Muslims would not be allowed to patronize his (oops HER business – see how I assumed that the range was owned by a man?) I was outraged. At the same time, I started thinking that of course something like this would happen in Arkansas, and how this woman was probably a Republican.  While I would never make a business decision based on those things, the fact that my mind even went there says something about me.</p>

<p> It's hard not to think about a topic like this in terms of my own life experiences, both good and bad.  I started  thinking about the times that I've felt the effects of gender stereotyping throughout my life, and how, most recently, I've started feeling irrelevant and invisible because of my age and the physical changes that come with growing older.  My mind keeps going back to a pithy saying on a card that I considered buying for a friend, “getting older is like an increasingly severe punishment for a crime that you didn't commit.” It's a really bad feeling to walk through life knowing that societal expectations of you are decreasing with each passing year. In the end, though,  I do consider myself an optimist.  While I do think that it will be harder for me, as a 40-something, to find a job, I don't think it's impossible.</p>
