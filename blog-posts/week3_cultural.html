      <h2>An Exploration of my Gregorc Learning Style</h2><br>

      <span class="post-date">September 14, 2014</span>
<p>My thinking style is Concrete Sequential.  For better and for worse, I think that the CS description is an  accurate reflection of the way I currently think and learn.  As a concrete thinker, I take in information based on direct observation â€“ what I see in front of me.  I am also a linear thinker, which means that I learn better when I have an outline or plan to work from.</p>

<p>I think that my learning style is well suited to following a structured curriculum with a road map for each week. I enjoy coding challenges, working on my website, and writing blog posts.  The biggest struggles for me so far at DBC have been pairing and open-ended assignments such reading and learning about HTML 5, or studying time management techniques.   Also, I tend to go down rabbit holes when I don't understand something.  I feel like I can't move onto the next concept until I've completely mastered the one I'm currently on.</p>

<p>After reading about concrete sequential learning, it makes sense that assignments where we are expected to research something are more difficult.   I think that time boxing and the idea of minimum viable product are strategies I can use to work more efficiently.  I can spend a certain amount of time on something, table it and move on the next thing, and then go back if I have time later.  This requires learning to be more comfortable with random thinking.</p>

<p>Pairing is difficult for a number of reasons.  First, I  am shy around people I don't know and tend to overthink social interactions.  I don't really know how to fix this other than reminding myself that other people are probably not as critical of me as I am of myself.   Second, I am uncomfortable in situations where I don't know the answer, or where I haven't had the chance to review or rehearse material ahead of time.  I panic when I'm faced with a new concept that I don't understand immediately, and my instinct is to want get out of the situation as fast as possible and figure it out on my own.  I think that checking in with my pair when this happens might be a good strategy.  Also, I think that with practice, pairing will get easier.</p>

<p>I would like to work on getting better at thinking conceptually, since it's so important to be able to visualize concepts when solving coding problems.  I find pseudocoding and breaking large problems into smaller chunks is extremely helpful for me.</p>

<p>I also want to learn to work better in groups, and not be afraid of looking foolish.  I know that being afraid of being wrong, and shutting down when faced with things that are hard to understand are both characteristics of a fixed mindset.  Being aware of these tendencies has helped so far. I've also started practicing thinking out loud when I am working by myself, and pretending that I have to explain my thought process to someone else.</p>

<p>I found the following resources useful while researching this question:</p>
