      <h2>Software Development is a Team Sport</h2><br>
      <span class="post-date">August 31, 2014</span>
<p>Before watching the chat, I did not realize how large a role collaboration would play in the experience. Now, I'm realizing that learning to work technically with other people is going to be a big part of DBC.  I'm looking forward to it, but also apprehensive. Learning not to feel insecure and compare myself to other people will be a challenge. What Shereef said about imposter syndrome definitely holds true for me.
       </p>
<p>I was expecting more of a focus on learning specific tools, but after watching the video, and after a week of going through the challenges in the Phase 0 curriculum, I know that this isn't really the case.  That makes sense, because the tools will always change.
</p>
The idea of the kitchen mindset vs the restaurant mindset was also interesting to me. I'm thinking of DBC more as an experience that the cohort will build together within the framework of the curriculum.  Before, I was thinking of it as a Nine Week Course at the End of Which I Will be a Junior Software Developer.
</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really excited and feeling positive about DBC.  That being said, I am feeling a bit nervous right now because it took me so long to get through the work this week.   I'm not sure if I am just slow, overthink things, or am not as focused as I think I am.  I can identify some of the reasons why I am still working on Sunday afternoon.  First, I didn't start on the work until Wednesday. I lost Monday to a day of plane travel.  On Tuesday, I spent the day recovering from the trip and getting the apartment back in order.  Wednesday, I sat down, but was not very focused.  From Wednesday afternoon until now, I have been pushing to get everything done. I feel frazzled.  For next week, I plan on working on time management in addition to starting the work earlier.  I've installed <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com" target="_blank">Rescue Time</a>, and I hope that helps me be more accountable for the time I spend online when I'm not working.</p>
