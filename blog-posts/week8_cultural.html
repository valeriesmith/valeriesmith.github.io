<p>When I was living in France, I lived in an  apartment that was not in very good shape, even by French standards.  The bathroom was particularly bad.  The toilet would wobble every time we sat down on it (because we were fat, according to our landlady), and some previous tenant had sealed off gaps between the wall and the pipes but stuffing socks into them.   In the 3.5 years that we lived in Paris, we were never in a position to move.  My landlady, while not fundamentally a bad person, was very busy, and was out of the city most of the time.  She also seemed to have a blind spot as far as the state of the apartment was concerned.</p>

<p>The conflict arose about a year into our stay there.  The downstairs neighbor came up to report that water from our bathroom was leaking into her closet, making it unusable.  This came as a complete surprise, since we had not seen any evidence of water leakage at all.  However, given the general state of the bathroom, I wasn't exactly shocked.  The rules  in France regarding renter vs landlord responsibilities with respect to insurance claims are a bit different than they are here, but no less confusing, especially for an outsider.  Basically, if the water damage was not caused by overflowing water, it's not the responsibility of the tenant. Since we hadn't had any flooding incidents, I thought I could just let my landlady know and let her take the appropriate action.</p>

<p>However, the landlady refused to get involved, claiming that even if she was the owner of the apartment, it was our responsibility as the tenants to get our insurance to cover the repairs.  Obviously, my insurance company scoffed at this request.  Without going into too much detail, the whole situation quickly devolved into a blame game between all parties involved.  After many months, it came to light that not only had this happened before, but the  problem was being caused by building-wide plumbing problems that had to be handled by the homeowners association of the building.  I never found out how much my landlady knew about this and how much she just wanted to ignore the problem or pass it on to other people. </p>

<p>I don't know what I could have done differently in this situation.  I could have been more assertive with the landlady, but it's hard in a situation where you don't know the laws and ins and out of things like insurance and your status as a non-citizen comes into play.   I really didn't have any power in the situation, other than breaking the lease and moving out of the apartment.  Honestly, I  still get angry when I think about this experience.  I do recognize that harboring a grudge is unproductive and a waste of energy.  I have two big takeaways from this experience.</p>

<p>I get less angry if I think of the bathroom situation as a mis-alignment of goals rather than a case where the landlady was out to take advantage of me.  It really had little to do with me personally. Her goal were to have the problem fixed  with as little financial or time involvement as possible.   My goal was to stop the downstairs neighbor from bothering me about her closet and to stop being blamed for a situation over which I clearly had no control.  In a future situation, trying to agree on a shared outcome might be a way to lessen conflict.</p>

<p>Being in a conflict where there was a power imbalance was a really good learning experience.  In conflict situations where I am on the other side of that imbalance, I've learned both not to take advantage and also to consider how the other person is feeling.</p>
