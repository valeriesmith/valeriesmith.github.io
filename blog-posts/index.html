      In this week's post, I'll address the art of asking technical questions. The first step in finding the answer to a question is figuring out if you even have to ask the question at all.  Has it already been answered?  Use Google to look for reference material, blog posts, or forum posts that might address your question.   If you're getting an error message, Google the error message itself.<br>

      When I was living in France, I lived in an  apartment that was not in very good shape, even by French standards.  The bathroom was particularly bad.  The toilet would wobble every time we sat down on it (because we were fat, according to our landlady), and some previous tenant had sealed off gaps between the wall and the pipes but stuffing socks into them.   In the 3.5 years that we lived in Paris, we were never in a position to move.  My landlady, while not fundamentally a bad person, was very busy, and was out of the city most of the time.  She also seemed to have a blind spot as far as the state of the apartment was concerned.<br>

Will-power is the means by which I force myself to do things that are unappealing in the moment but that are ultimately beneficial to me or to the people I care about.<br>

      At the beginning of DBC, the combination of my lack of confidence in my technical ability and my feeling of social awkwardness made me dread pairing.  Over the past five weeks, it has mostly become a good experience.   I don't know if I will ever totally be in my comfort zone while pairing, especially remotely.  However, it has gotten a lot easier with practice.<br>

It is not his or her job to make judgement calls about what the shirt looks like or how it should be constructed.<br>

      The inject method in Ruby is commonly used as a way to accumulate a collection of objects.  Given a set of objects, it will iterate over each one, executing whatever code is specified, and return a result. Inject is useful for dealing with collections of objects, such as strings, arrays, and hashes.  Let's have a look at the format, and then I will go over some possible use cases.<br>

I am also a linear thinker, which means that I learn better when I have an outline or plan to work from.<br>

      Javascript's popularity stems from the fact that is able to be interpreted by most browsers without any action on the part of the user.  From the perspective of a web developer, JavaScript is lightweight and easy to use.  The code can be written in any text editor, and it is immediately ready to be tested and deployed without having to be compiled.<br>

      Margins, borders, and padding are all ways to create white space and create visual boundaries between elements on a web page. It's important to remember that all three of these all take up space on the page. When you're trying to determine the width of the various elements on your page, you must take this into account and adjust the widths of the parent elements accordingly.<br>

      Before watching the chat, I did not realize how large a role collaboration would play in the experience. Now, I'm realizing that learning to work technically with other people is going to be a big part of DBC.  I'm looking forward to it, but also apprehensive. Learning not to feel insecure and compare myself to other people will be a challenge. What Shereef said about imposter syndrome definitely holds true for me.<br>

      I have been using this site every day for several months, because I'm sick of my music collection on iTunes, and to expose myself to different types of music. I splurged and got the subscription service, which is worth it to me since I have it on constantly. The focal point of the site is the area where the track information is displayed. The name of the track and the album art take up most of the real estate in the center of the page, which I would expect since I go there to listen to tracks.  Visually, I'd describe the site as minimalist, utilitarian, modular, neutral, and boxy. It isn't badly designed but it's very simple and focused; there isn't a lot of extraneous content visible at the top level.<br>
